# Data types in C++

They are used to define the type of variables and contents used. Data types define the way you use storage in the programs you write. There are 2 types of data types in C++ in general.

1.Built in Data Types.
2.User defined or Abstract data types.

# Basic Built in Data types:

char : for character storage ( 1 byte )

int : for integral number ( 2 bytes )

float : single precision floating point 
( 4 bytes )

double : double precision floating point numbers ( 8 bytes )


# Example:

	char a = 'x';         // character type
	int a = 10;           // integer type
	float a = 3.14159;    // floating point type decimal numbers
	double a = 2e-5;      // double type (e is for exponential)
